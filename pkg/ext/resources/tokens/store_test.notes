NewSystemTokenStore	core constructor // no admin checks
NewTokenStore		     		 // admin checks -> SAR mocking

Basic mocking of secret client/cache, userattr, user client

cache: update, get, delete
note: creation from wrangler may properly share the cache among several token stores
alt:  move creation of system token store up the call chain, make it part of wrangler context?

Create - token store only, not system store - todo expose that for future system-internal token creation

Update
	(TokenStore: fail to check admin
		fail to check user full permissions)

	fail on retrieval of backing secret
	fail on conversion of secret to token
		fail to parse enabled			/bool
		fail to parse is-derived		/bool
		fail to parse tll			/int
		fail to unmarshal user principal	/json
		fail to set expired
			fail to to marshal time

	fail on change of user id
	fail on change of cluster name
	fail on change of `IsDerived`, i.e. flag `is this a login token`
	
	fail on change of TTL extension for non-admin	// can we test `update`, note lower-case

	fail on conversion of token to secret
		fail to marshal user principal	/json

	fail on update of backing secret
	fail on reading back token (2nd conversion of secret to token)

Get
	fail on retrieval of backing secret
	fail on conversion of secret to token	(Details s.a.)

	(TokenStore: fail to check admin)

List
	(TokenStore: fail to check user full permissions)

	fail on failure to list secrets
	note: secret to token conversion errors are ignored


Delete
	fail on retrieval of backing secret
	fail on conversion of secret to token	(Details s.a.)
	fail on failure to delete secret
